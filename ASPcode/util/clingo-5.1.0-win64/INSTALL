# Some notes to get started running the binaries

To run the executables in this archive, the Visual C++ Redistributable for
Visual Studio 2015 has to be installed.  To use Python and Lua enabled
gringo-script.exe and clingo-script.exe executables, Python 2.7 has to be
installed.  Both requirements can be downloaded from their respective websites.
For convenience, the installers are available in the third-party folder.

To use the clingo Python module, the file python-api\clingo.pyd has to be
available in Python's search path.  For quickly getting started, a simple
solution is to copy the file in the same folder as the Python script importing
the clingo module.  It is also possible to set Python's search path to point to
the folder containing the module.  Please check the Python documentation for
more information.  Another option (not recommended) to make the module globally
available is to copy clingo.pyd into the dll folder of the python installation.
To check if the installation worked, try one of the python examples:

    cd examples\clingo\robots
    python visualize.py
